
We're using TCP and are trying to sen 36000 messages per minute. We have two clients each sending 36000 messages
and receiving. These are the test result data:

On localhost:
nMessages=36000  -  time=0.365s
nMessages=360000 -  time=2.738s
nMessages=3600000 - time=26.009s


from a computer in hamnen to a computer on TBV
nMessages=36000	 -  time=0.53s
nMessages=360000 -  time=4.84s
